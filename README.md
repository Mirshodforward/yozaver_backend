## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Live deployment

The API runs on the DigitalOcean droplet `161.35.27.123` at `/root/yozaver`, served
through Nginx at `https://api.yozaver.uz`. The frontend is on Vercel at
`https://www.yozaver.uz` and reaches this API cross-origin.

That droplet already hosts several unrelated production sites and has under 1 GB of
RAM, so this deployment deliberately **does not use Docker**: it reuses the system
PostgreSQL 14 and the PM2 instance that are already running there. `Dockerfile`,
`compose.production.yml` and `scripts/deploy.sh` describe the alternative
container-based setup for a dedicated 2 GB+ host, and are unused on this box.

| Piece | Value |
| --- | --- |
| App directory | `/root/yozaver` |
| Process | PM2 app `yozaver-api`, port 4000 (localhost only) |
| Database | system PostgreSQL 14, database `yozaver_db`, role `yozaver` |
| Nginx site | `/etc/nginx/sites-available/yozaver-api` → `127.0.0.1:4000` |
| Secrets | `/root/yozaver/.env`, mode 600, never committed |

Redeploy after pushing to `main`:

```bash
ssh root@161.35.27.123 'bash /root/yozaver/scripts/redeploy-pm2.sh'
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pm2 logs yozaver-api --lines 50
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4000/health/ready     # {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
sudo -u postgres psql -d yozaver_db -c '\dt'
```

## Observability

In production applications, observability is essential for understanding how your system behaves, detecting issues early, and maintaining reliable performance.

[NestJS Observe](https://observe.nestjs.com) automatically instruments your NestJS application, giving you deep visibility into your system with minimal setup:

- **Distributed tracing:** Follow requests across services and understand how they flow through your system.
- **Waterfall analysis:** Visualize request execution and identify slow operations, bottlenecks, and unexpected delays.
- **Performance analysis:** Analyze application performance in real time and quickly pinpoint areas that need optimization.
- **Metrics:** Track key application and infrastructure metrics to understand system health and performance trends.
- **Logging:** Centralize and correlate logs with traces and other telemetry to make debugging easier.
- **Error tracking:** Detect errors quickly and investigate their root causes with the surrounding context.
- **SLA monitoring:** Track service-level objectives and identify when your application is approaching or exceeding defined thresholds.
- **Alarms and alerts:** Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, SLA violations, and other anomalies so your team can react quickly.
